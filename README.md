Age Calculator in C++

The Age Calculator is a C++ program designed to determine a person's exact age by calculating the difference between their birth date and the current date. Upon running the program, the user is asked to enter their date of birth, including the day, month, and year. The program then processes this information, taking into account leap years and the varying number of days in each month, to provide an accurate age calculation.

The program outputs the age in terms of years, months, and days, offering a comprehensive view of how old the person is as of the current date. This program is a practical tool for learning about date manipulation, conditional statements, and loops in C++. The code is structured to be beginner-friendly, with clear comments and logical flow to aid in understanding.
